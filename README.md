# Transcript-level RNA-seq data analysis using human T2T reference

This repository contains scripts for transcript-level RNA-seq data analysis using human T2T reference. 

To run these scripts, save RNA-seq data into `data/reads`, and download reference genome and gene annotation file info `reference`. The scripts should be run from the project root directory.
